     <p>You are the light that finds me in the dark,<br>
        The quiet smile that stays in my heart.<br>
        Like air I breathe, like thoughts I keep,<br>
        You’re the feeling that runs deep.<br>

        Not just today, not just for a while —<br>
        You’re my peace, my strength, my smile. ❤️</p>
